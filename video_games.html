     Games I've played.

Here's a collection of games I played. This is to keep a record, to recommend, and to just keep track. I'll also have a to-play list at the bottom.
<br/>
<br/>
I have my most played and recommended games at the top. Some of these are also what you'd call "forever games". That is, games I play over and over.
I realise now they might be "forever games" because they keep coming up on platforms I move to which makes them easy to get and play.

<h3>Recommended and Most Played</h3>

<ul>
    <li><a href="" style="text-decoration: none;color: #2ecec2;"><u>Resident Evil 4 Remake</u></a> - I never thought they could top the original game. They did. </li>
        <li><a href="" style="text-decoration: none;color: #2ecec2;"><u>Tekken 8</u></a> - This is my chess. I am currently a <i>Fujin</i> rank. I have a long way to go to reach <i>Tekken King</i>. I main Reina.</li>
                <li><a href="" style="text-decoration: none;color: #2ecec2;"><u>Box Boy and Box Girl</u></a> - Extremely simple in its design but a game with a high degree of depth. Addictive and fun puzzles.</li>
                        <li><a href="" style="text-decoration: none;color: #2ecec2;"><u>Balatro</u></a> - A highly addicting card game based on poker hands.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Other Games</h3>

<ul>

<li><a href="" style="text-decoration: none;color: #2ecec2;"><u>Onimusha</u></a> - I'm so happy they are remaking this.</li>
<li><a href="" style="text-decoration: none;color: #2ecec2;"><u>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</u></a> - A game I am currently playing. The first game had a lot of detractors but for me, it was an unforgettable experience.</li>
